# Controlling-RC-CAR-using-Tilt-sensor
implementation of a hand gesture–controlled RC car. By using a glove equipped with a tilt sensor and an ESP32 microcontroller, the system translates hand movements into commands to control the car’s motion wirelessly. The goal of this project is to explore alternative methods of interacting with robotic systems.
